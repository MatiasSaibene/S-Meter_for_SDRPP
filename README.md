Video demostration:
[![ S-Meter demo v0.1.0 for SDR++ ](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Nfl_-jtbemo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfl_-jtbemo)

This is a small plugin (still in development) that displays signal strength in S-Units. For SDR++.

It still has bugs and is not finished/polished.

BUGS to fix:
-Zooming distorts the measurement.
-Switching from AM to USB or LSB causes the measurement to fail.
-The menu appears twice.

Things to add (in development):
-Clock with UTC time
-Log results with average power/noise/signal fade every 1 minute, 30 minutes, or 1 hour.
